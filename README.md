# Eventually - Stunning HTML5 Landing Page

This was to practice making good responsive html page with plain css.

![Design for the project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedamn-projects/eventually-stunning-html5-landing-page/master/designs/Landing%20Page%20%5BDesktop%5D.jpg)


## Where to find everything

Task was to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in image formats (sketch and figma designs coming soon).

You will find all the required assets in the `/assets` folder. These include images, fonts, etc.

There is also a `style-guide.html` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and font names. Make sure to open this in the browser to see the contents.
